# Barotrauma Circuitry Archives: For the Crew's Eyes Only (and trusted friends)

### Welcome aboard, brave souls and unfortunate clowns!

This repository serves as the highly-classified, yet conveniently public, documentation for the labyrinthine and often-questionable electrical circuits powering our magnificent submersible. If you're reading this, you're either part of the crew, a friend of the crew, or a particularly resourceful husk that's figured out how to use a computer. In any case, welcome.

The primary mission of this archive is to create a living 'meme documentation' of every single circuit we've jury-rigged, over-engineered, or barely-got-working in our glorious underwater adventures. Expect a delightful mix of technical diagrams that would make a sane engineer weep, and commentary that questions the very fabric of our reality (and our sanity).

Now get to work. And for the love of the Honkmother, don't lick the junction boxes.
